	  <h3>Who I am and why I'm qualified (enough) </h3>
	  <p>
		SO, my name is Rami Naser, I graduated from LWW in 2021 and Im currently studying cyber security at IIT in chicago. I feel like the correlation is pretty obvious but in case it isn't
		I'm studying the exact things that are done in the cyber patriot competition and going further. I've taken a few classes already that can immediately help with the competition
		but I also know a lot from being in your spot as a competitor for 4 years. Just a sidenote here, as a few of you know already or found out when I went to central for the intrest meeeting I 
		am not a stiff by any means. I joke around and do not take much super seriously I will try and get you to actually compete well but Im not going to be making sure your silent and diligently working we have fun first and foremost.

	  <h3> why I'm doing this </h3>
	  <p>
	    This section is mostly for parents who are curious about who will be teching and coaching their kids. I do have a background check done by the AirForce for the purpose of cyberpatriot.
		I feel like its important to state my intentions and reasons for doing this, unfortunatly in this day and age there is a lot of suspicion when a guy wants to come back and spend
        a lot of time at his old highschool. I understand this 100% from a parental point of view. Its very simple though, I do this because I fell in love with cyber security and found a lot of 
        direction in life through doing this competition under guidence of older students when I was a freshman. It provided me with an insight into what my career could look like, 
		helped me develop and hone skills that helped me get my first job in tech as well as becoming a lab assistant my 2nd semester of college. If I can help nudge some of you into
		finding a passion for this field, or something related, I will.
